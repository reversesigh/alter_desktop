# ALTER_desktop    
Create an unofficial [ALTER](https://altermail.live/) desktop application by wrapping with [`nativefier`](https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier).  ALTER_desktop is currently supported on linux (x64) and macOS (x64/arm)
  
Feel free to message me after installing and logging in to test it out: `az4jnb2ngz`  

Use at your own risk at the moment - as there are some oddities with npm that need resolved still. Consider this very alpha. You can try running this on other linux distributions, but it's not officially supported yet.
