# ALTER_desktop  
Unofficial Nativefier desktop app for [ALTER](https://altermail.live/) private messaging service. Currently only supported for linux-x64

Use at your own risk at the moment - as there are some oddities with npm that need resolved still. Consider this very alpha. You can try running this on other linux distributions, but it's not officially supported yet.

#### 3. Known Issues
- If ALTER_desktop is added as a favorite in GNOME and appears in your Dash, it will still open a new icon in the open window instance instead of working with the initial favorite icon.
- Clicking "X" to minimize to tray will close your session and you will need to re-enter your keys.
- I am unable to run ALTER_desktop on my VM instance for macOS and instead am relying on friends to test my script. Please keep in mind I am not a macOS user and feel free to let me know of any issues.
