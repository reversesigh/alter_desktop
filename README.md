### ALTER_desktop  
Create an unofficial ALTER desktop application using `nativefier`. This is intended to make it easy for ALTER users to have a desktop instance of ALTER without worrying about creating their own desktop entry. Scripts currently work with Linux distributions. Not tested on Windows or MacOS.
