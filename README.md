Create an unofficial [ALTER](https://altermail.live/) Linux desktop application using [`nativefier`](https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier). This is intended to make it easy for ALTER users to have a desktop instance of ALTER without worrying about creating their own desktop entry. Scripts currently work with Linux distributions.
